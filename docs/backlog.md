# WinForge Feature Backlog · 功能待辦

North star: **≥1000 working features across 200+ modules**, run as a continuous Ralph loop. Each iteration: pull from this backlog, implement real (pure-managed) features + modules, fix bugs, verify **build + tests green**, then push → deploy → merge to main. Never stop adding ideas. Themes: **(A) improve Windows · (B) embed open-source apps (respect licenses: compatibility + attribution) · (C) extend existing modules**.

Guardrail: nothing merges/deploys unless `dotnet build WinForge.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64` = 0 errors **and** `tests/ReactorSim.Tests` = 62/62.

  JSON Patch (RFC 6902 diff+apply), JSONL/NDJSON Tools, Text Wrap/Reflow, Short ID Encoder (Base62/58/36/Crockford + NanoID), Dotenv Editor (parse/validate/convert to shell·JSON·docker), HTTP Headers Reference (~80 headers), Calendar (month grid + ISO weeks). Clean pitfall-scan — no agent slips this batch; build 0 errors, tests 62/62.
- **Batch 15 — DONE: +8 modules → 264.**
  JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386), ULID/Snowflake generator+decoder, Hosts File Editor (safe non-elevated + block-list presets), iCalendar (.ics) Builder (RRULE/VALARM), Ascii85/Base85 (Adobe·Z85·RFC1924), Security Header Scorecard (A+..F grading), Box & Banner Text, Number-to-Words+ (currency + Chinese 大寫). Clean pitfall-scan — no agent slips; build 0 errors, tests 62/62. Also fixed CI: `pages.yml` now chains off the site-data workflow via `workflow_run` (token-authored regen commits couldn't trigger the deploy → live site had gone stale); README/CLAUDE.md counts refreshed to 264; GitHub repo description updated.
- **Batch 16 — DONE: +8 modules → 272.**

- **Batch 17 — DONE: +8 modules → 277 (first ⚛️ reactor loads shipped).**
  ⚛️ **Grid Dispatch Center** + ⚛️ **Hydrogen Electrolysis** — both gate real work on the live reactor via `ReactorStatusApiService.I.LastSnapshot` (ElectricMW/IsGenerating/Mode/IsScrammed), show a MW meter + "needs nuclear power" empty-state, draw a defined MW load. Plus 6 general: UUID v7, JSON Schema Validator, HTML Entities, URL Query Editor, Morse Code, Roman Numerals. Pre-merge fix: both reactor agents mishandled `ReactorStatusSnapshot` (a value struct) as nullable — corrected to `default` / `is { } r`. Build 0 errors, tests 62/62.
- **Batch 18 — DONE: +7 modules → 291.**
  ⚛️ 3 more reactor loads (all also EARN ⚡ Watts into the economy): **Seawater Desalination**, **EV Fast-Charge Depot**, **Pumped-Storage Hydro** (a grid buffer that stores surplus nuclear power and regenerates MWe when the reactor is down). Plus general: YAML↔JSON, Slugify, Passphrase (Diceware), Line Sort & Dedupe. Also prior batches shipped the ⚛️ economy (Reactor Bank + ⚡ Watts) and heavy loads (AI Cluster, HPC, Compute Mine, Smelter, Data Center, Collider). Clean scan; build 0 errors, tests 62/62.
- **Next focus:** keep shipping ⚛️ reactor loads (remaining: District Heating, Vertical Farm) + general modules; deepen the ⚡ economy. At **291 modules** / 18 iterations.

## Bug / hardening priorities (fold into every iteration)
- [x] **Freezes — round 1:** offloaded WMI/PDH/`Process.GetProcesses`/sensor ticks to `Task.Run` (SystemMonitor, ProcessExplorer, Connections, BatteryThermal, NativeUtilities); off-thread registry-hive enumeration; Unloaded timer stops (ScreenRecorder); calmed CakeFactory 80ms→200ms; fixed `LanguageChanged` leaks on the hot pages.
- [~] **Freezes — round 2 (structural):** all batch-1/2/3 modules ship leak-safe (named `LanguageChanged` handlers). Round 2 also converted **20 existing pages** off the inline-lambda leak (AdvancedPaste, AltSnap, AppUninstaller, Awake, BulkOps, Clipboard, ColorPicker, CommandPalette, Communications, ContextMenu, Devices, Decompiler, CropAndLock, Camoufox, CaptureStudio, ConfigBackup, Connectors, AndroidAdb, Rename, EnvVars). Round 2 continued: +10 pages, then +12 more (Blender, DiagramEditor, DiffMerge, DiskAnalyzer, DiskBenchmark, Duplicates, Emulator, EventViewer, EverythingSearch, Fastboot, FileLocksmith, FileServer). Round 2 continued again: +12 more (ZoomIt, TimeUnit, ScreenRuler, QuickType, TextOcr, HexEditor, PdfToolkit, TestDisk, RustDesk, WebCloner, WorldMonitor, ImagingGame). Round 2 continued again: +12 more (Winfetch, FontManager, GifLab, Flashcards, NewPlus, DiskHealth, PowerToysExtras, PixelEditor, VolumeMixer, Keyboard, WindowManager, ImageEditor). Round 2 continued again: +12 more (Mouse, Drives, OneDrive, VaultVolumes, MouseUtils, SystemDoctors, VpnMesh, Workspaces, YtDlp, Torrent, Proxmox, Docker), then +12 more (AiAgents, AiChat, CategoryPage, Dashboard, HomeAssistant, LightSwitch, Mail, MinecraftLauncher, MinecraftServer, MinecraftWorldTools, MouseWithoutBorders, SearchResults). **Leaking pages: ~96 → ~3 — round 2 ESSENTIALLY DONE.** Remaining ~3 are deliberately-skipped complex ones (PackageManager — background scheduler + multiple CTS; Amulet — external process tracking) accepted as low-risk; convert only if touching them anyway.
- [~] **Freezes — round 3:** DONE `CropAndLockService.CreateFromScreenRectAsync` (removed the `Done.Wait(4000)` UI-thread block via `TaskCompletionSource` + `await Task.WhenAny(..., Task.Delay(4000))`; caller updated). LEFT `NativeMessagePump._ready.Wait(1500)` (inside a `lock`, shared by 4 services, near-instant — risky to convert). STILL TODO: audit remaining sync-over-async (`.Result`/`.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` in AdvancedPaste/PlainTextPaste/ReactorStatusClient/Ftp).

## UI overhaul epic — ZERO tweak cards (theme C)
Replace `Controls/TweakCard` (generic `TweakDefinition` renderer, 11 Kinds) with structured, animated, real-control UI (NOT card chrome). Data model: `Catalog/TweakCatalog.cs` → `TweakDefinition`.
**Phase 1 — 20 modules + SettingsHub converted; shared renderer built.** Converted off TweakCard: Archives, Cloudflare, TaskbarTweaker, Media, Rainmeter, GlazeWm, Windhawk, ShellMenu, Nmap, NilesoftShell, LibreOffice, FancyZones, Packer, Komorebi, VsCode, Wireshark, Terminal, GitHub, AudioEditor, Ollama — each tweak → a Grid row (Action→Button awaiting RunAsync, Toggle→ToggleSwitch, Choice/RadioGroup→ComboBox/RadioButtons, Slider/Number→Slider/NumberBox, Info→refreshable TextBlock), one persistent `InfoBar`, `EntranceThemeTransition`, subtle dividers (no card chrome), behavior preserved.
**`Controls/ControlRowList.cs` — the reusable renderer** (`SetTweaks`/`Clear`) now backs the catalog-driven pages **SettingsHub, CategoryPage, SearchResultsPage, DashboardPage**, and the last stragglers **Amulet, Blender, FileZilla** (which used the fully-qualified `new Controls.TweakCard()` form) were converted too.
## 🎉 ZERO TWEAK CARDS — DONE.
No page instantiates `TweakCard` anymore (grep-verified: 0 `new TweakCard`/`new Controls.TweakCard`/`SetTweak` across Pages/). Every tweak now renders as a real, animated control row via per-module builders or the shared `ControlRowList`. **Cleanup left:** `Controls/TweakCard.xaml(.cs)` is now dead code — delete it (+ its `App.xaml` resource refs, and stale mentions in AGENTS.md) in a dedicated low-risk iteration.
Conversion order (lowest risk first):
1. Info/status catalogs (read-only) → structured status sections.
2. Simple toggle catalogs (Appearance, Explorer) → labelled `ToggleSwitch` rows.
3. Action-heavy modules (Terminal, Packer, Komorebi, GitHub) → control rows + persistent result `InfoBar`.
4. `SettingsHubModule` / `CategoryPage` / `SearchResultsPage` (catalog-driven, ~1,174 tweaks) → `Expander`-grouped control grids.
5. Wizard/multi-step last → `FlipView`/paged navigation.
Add Fluent entrance/state animations throughout.

## ⚛️ Epic: "Requires nuclear generation" — reactor-powered industrial loads (goal 2026-07-01)
Standing goal from the user: **keep finding (and building) more stuff that requires the flagship reactor's
electrical output.** Pattern to follow (same as CakeFactoryService): a module gates its real work on
`ReactorSimService.ElectricPowerMW` (rated ~1150 MWe gross) / an energized reactor bus, draws a defined MW
load, and degrades/stops when the reactor is subcritical, tripped, or in MODE 5. All in-app, bilingual,
reversible; opt-in; never breaks the reactor safety invariants. Candidate loads (each = one module drawing
reactor MW):
- (Reactor) **Grid Dispatch Center** — sell MWe to a simulated grid: demand curve, spot price, frequency
  regulation, load-following against the turbine setpoint; revenue only when generating.
- (Reactor) **AI Training Cluster** — a datacenter whose GPU racks only train while fed ≥N MW from the bus;
  ties into the existing AI-credits economy (cake→credits) as a compute sink.
- (Reactor) **Hydrogen Electrolysis Plant** — high-temp electrolysis; kg H₂/h scales with available MW.
- (Reactor) **Seawater Desalination** — MED/RO plant; m³/day potable water gated on reactor power + waste heat.
- (Reactor) **Aluminium Smelter / Arc Furnace** — huge continuous pot-line load; brownout if power dips.
- (Reactor) **EV Fast-Charge Depot** — stalls charge only when the bus is up; fleet SoC economy.
- (Reactor) **District Heating Loop** — cogeneration: bleed steam + electric trace heating for a city.
- (Reactor) **Crypto/Compute Mine** — hashrate ∝ MW; explicit "only runs on nuclear" framing.
- (Reactor) **Pumped-Storage Hydro** — store surplus MWe by pumping uphill, regenerate on demand (grid buffer).
- (Reactor) **Vertical Farm / Greenhouse Array** — grow-light + HVAC load; yield gated on continuous power.
- (Reactor) **Data-of-record / Home Assistant mirror** already exists — extend with a live MW-budget dashboard
  that shows every connected load and sheds the lowest-priority ones on undervoltage (load-shed simulator).
Build cadence: fold 1–2 of these into each Ralph iteration as real reactor-integrated modules (read
`ElectricPowerMW`, gate work, show a MW meter), verified green + reactor tests 62/62 before merge.
