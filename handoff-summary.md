# WinForge Full Development Handoff

## Latest continuation record — 2026-07-16

**Native Regex Cheatsheet / 原生 Regex 速查表**

- `module.regexcheat` is now a real C++/WinRT route, not a pending page. Its pure-C++ immutable catalog preserves 67 bilingual reference rows in nine categories and eight copy-only ready-made patterns. .NET-only reference syntax stays documentation; only an explicitly enabled, bounded PCRE2 local filter is evaluated.
- The native builder now targets this fourth registered local search surface. Invalid filters retain the preceding visible rows; static reference data never reaches a command line, package engine, network, or process. Clipboard writes require an explicit Copy button.
- Evidence: Debug and Release native suites each passed **395/395**; catalog parity passed 346 fixed routes, five dynamic families, 319 registry entries, and 22 categories; the isolated LowLevel MCP headless UI Automation shell passed **224/224**, including Cheatsheet filtering, invalid-pattern retention, explicit Copy, builder handoff, and horizontal bounds.
- Visual evidence is honestly `capture-blocked`: inspected LowLevel MCP full-window **852×880** and client-only **836×841** frames had a title bar/blank client and a blank client respectively. Both temporary PNGs were discarded; no stale, synthetic, or managed substitute was used as native proof.
- Integration rule: commit and push this record with the task, merge it into `main`, fetch and prove the commit/branch tip are ancestors of `origin/main`, then clean up only after that remote proof.

**原生 Regex 速查表 / Native Regex Cheatsheet**

- `module.regexcheat` 而家係真正嘅 C++/WinRT route，唔再係 pending page。純 C++ 不變 catalog 保留 67 項雙語參考、九個分類同八個只可明確複製嘅現成模式。
- 速查表成為第四個已註冊嘅本機 regex 搜尋 surface；只有明確開啟時先會以有資源限制嘅 PCRE2 篩選靜態文字。無效模式會保留原有結果，唔會送去命令列、套件引擎、網絡或者程序。
- 驗證：Debug/Release 都通過 **395/395**；catalog parity 通過；隔離 LowLevel MCP headless UI Automation 通過 **224/224**。852×880 full-frame 同 836×841 client-frame 都係空白客戶端，所以已丟棄，視覺證據係 `capture-blocked`。

---

# Security Hardening

- Protected extraction boundaries.

---

## Elevated Execution

Fixed:
- User-writable executable execution risk while elevated.

Added:
- Refusal of unsafe elevated native compilation.
- Safer launch behavior.

Applications now avoid inheriting unnecessary administrator privileges.

---

## Web Bridge

Hardened:

- Origin handling.
- Payload size limits.
- Save operation handling.
- Cancellation behavior.

---

## Diagram Import

Fixed:

- Unsafe imported IDs being inserted into SVG.

Added:

---

## Admin Detection

Improved:

- Elevation checks.
- Fail-closed behavior when inspection fails.

---

# Updater

## Completed Updater Hardening

Implemented:

- SHA-256 verification.
- Side-by-side updater runtime.
- External updater helper.
- Mutex protection.
- Bounded download handling.
- Persistent updater logs.
- Legacy bootstrap recovery.

---

# Installer Fixes

Resolved:

Updated:
- Installer script.
- Launcher update recovery path.
- Updater startup flow.

---

# Logging

Added/improved:

- Persistent logs.
- Update diagnostics.
- Failure visibility.

---

# Build Validation

Completed:

- WinForge build.
- Launcher build.
- Updater build.
- Native companion build.
- Integration validation.

Important validation results:

- 0 build errors.
- Native companions launch successfully.
- Updater builds successfully.
- Git checks passed.

---

# UI Validation

Completed checks:

## WinForge Launcher
Passed:
- Application startup.
- Module loading.
- Launcher UI rendering.

## Image Editor
Passed:
- Module opening.
- Native editor launch path.
- Runtime dependency validation.

## CodeForge
Passed:
- First-run installation path testing.
- Monaco install security path validation.

---

# Run Skill / Automation Updates

Updated:

`.agents/skills/run-winforge`

Changes:
- Better publish failure handling.
- Stops stale WinForge processes before publishing.
- Avoids continuing after failed builds.
- Improved validation reliability.

Desktop automation was intentionally stopped before completion to avoid interfering with active applications.

---

# Deferred Request: Task Scheduler Auto Start

A request was made:

> Add Task Scheduler auto-run without UAC.

Decision:

Not implemented.

Reason:
- Creating a privileged scheduled task to bypass UAC would weaken Windows security.
- It could create a persistence/elevation risk.

Current behavior:
- Runs at normal user integrity.
- No UAC bypass.
- No hidden privileged startup.

Possible future safe alternative:
- Normal-user scheduled task.
- Startup shortcut.
- User-approved background service design.

# Continuation Update — Visible First-Run Compiler UX

Completed and committed on 2026-07-09:

- Expanded the native companion preparation popup into a resizable, bilingual terminal-style build window.
- Added separate phase/status UI, indeterminate progress, live batched stdout/stderr, selectable scrollback,
  Retry/Close states, and stable automation IDs.
- Blocked title-bar close while preparation is active. Cancel now waits for compiler process-tree cleanup before
  the window closes; a bounded cleanup-timeout state prevents an unclosable trap, disables unsafe Retry, and
  quarantines later native builds in that WinForge process until restart. Native preparation is process-wide
  serialized so a second companion cannot overlap cleanup or race the quarantine transition.
- Moved compiler discovery off the UI thread and made its filesystem/vswhere probes cancellation-aware.
- Added durable per-attempt logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WinForge\logs\companion-builds`, with UTF-8 output,
  per-companion retention, log-folder access, complete result diagnostics, and fail-open disk-error handling.
- Preserved the prebuilt/source-hash cache fast paths, temporary-exe cleanup, atomic publication, normal-integrity
  execution, and static MinGW linking.
- Added `tests/CompanionBuildLog.Tests` and registered it in `WinForge.sln`.

Validation completed:

- `dotnet build WinForge.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64` — 0 errors.
- `dotnet run --project tests/CompanionBuildLog.Tests -c Debug` — 4/4 passed.
- Self-contained publish and Image Editor module render — passed.
- Injected compiler failure — live stdout/stderr, blocked close, failure UI, Retry, and persistent log passed.
- Explicit Cancel — compiler exited before the preparation window closed; cancellation log passed.
- Genuine MSVC build — ImageForge compiled, cached, launched, and logged `SUCCESS`; prior cache was restored.

# Remaining Work / Future Tasks

## Updater UX Improvements

Potential improvements:

- Better progress display.
- Retry button.
- Detailed error messages.
- Update history.
- Recovery diagnostics.

---

## Logging Improvements

Potential:

- Central application log viewer.
- Export diagnostics bundle.
- Log rotation.
- Crash reporting.

---

# Important Development Notes

- Continue from `main`.
- Do not reset to old feature branches.
- Existing companion/security work is already merged.
- Avoid reintroducing elevated auto-start behavior.
- Preserve static native linking.
- Keep updater verification and integrity checks.

---

# Recommended Next Session Start

1. Review the committed visible compiler/log UX changes.
2. Re-run:
   - `git status`
   - build validation.
3. Continue with updater UX improvements (retry, richer errors, update history/recovery diagnostics).
4. Consider a central application log viewer and diagnostics-bundle export.

End state: WinForge is in a completed hardened state with remaining work focused mainly on UX improvements.
